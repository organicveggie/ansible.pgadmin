          Map of PostgreSQL server names to dictionaries of server details. Used to construct the

          Postgres server definitions. Every server definition must include the following entries:
            Name, Group, Port, Username, SSLMode, MaintenanceDB and one of Host, HostAddr or
            Service.
          See https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/import_export_servers.html for
          more details.
